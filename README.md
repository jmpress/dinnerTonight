# dinnerTonight
#### Answering the eternal question; What's for dinner tonight?
#### By Jeffrey Press

## Description
This simple app was built to practice manipulating strings and arrays of strings.<br>
I expect it to carry out the following behaviors:<br>
&emsp;**Behavior:** Program runs once, displays output, then stops<br>
&emsp;**Input:** Run the program, no other input required.<br>
&emsp;**Output:** A _madlibs_-style sentence made of several random adjectives is displayed to console, followed by a list of meal courses that correspond with those adjectives.<br>

## Specs
