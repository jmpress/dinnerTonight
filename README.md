# dinnerTonight
## Answering the eternal question; What's for dinner tonight?

### Description
This is a simple javascript program intended to run in Node. It is following the briefing from the Codecademy project titled "Mixed Messages", which I have reproduced at the end of this document.

When run, the program displays a randomly generated menu consisting of an appetizer, main course and side, and a dessert, along with a *mad-libs* style summary sentence generated from adjectives related to the specific foods that were randomly chosen, to whet the user's appetite.

The food/adjective pairs are stored in hard-coded arrays, and the messages are displayed to the console.

### Future extension ideas:
*Read data from files instead of hard-coded arrays, which would make it easier to add more foods to expand the users options.
*Create a front-end for a more readable and web-friendly user experience. (HTML/CSS)

### Original Project Briefing
For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

Project Objectives:

   + Build a message generator program using JavaScript
   + Use Git version control
   + Use command line
   + Develop locally on your computer

Prerequisites:

   + JavaScript
   + Git and GitHub
   + Command line
